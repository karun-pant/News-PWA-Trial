# News-PWA-Trial

Trying to create a News PWA with news.org apis. To contribute clone the repo and create a pull request.
# Future Works:

* Adding [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cacheable-response)
* Adding css to have better selector.
* Handle opaque images.
